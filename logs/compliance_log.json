Let me start by understanding the information given.\n\nThe decision is \"Rejected,\" so the user is already aware it's not approved, but the goal is to explain why in a clear and reassuring way. The key factors are Home Ownership, Purpose, Grade, and Interest Rate. Each has an impact that increases risk and their respective weight percentages.\n\nFirst, I should explain each factor in simple terms without technical jargon. Let's take them one by one.\n\nHome Ownership: The value is MORTGAGE, which apparently increases risk. So, maybe having a mortgage indicates higher debt already, which makes the lender see it as riskier. The weight is 31.2%, so it's a major factor.\n\nPurpose: It's for debt consolidation. Hmm, but debt consolidation can sometimes be a positive step if managed well. Wait, but in this case, the system might be flagging it as increasing risk. Maybe because consolidating debt, especially if the applicant still has high balances, could indicate ongoing financial challenges. The weight is 21%, also a significant portion.\n\nGrade: D. I assume this refers to the credit grade or grade of the loan application. A",
